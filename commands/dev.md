Start npm dev servers.

## Instructions

1. Check if dev servers are already running on common ports (3000, 5173, 8080, 4200)
   - If running, inform the user which ports are in use and ask if they want to proceed

2. Run `npm run dev` in the current directory

3. If npm run dev fails or doesn't exist, suggest alternatives:
   - `npm start`
   - `yarn dev`
   - `pnpm dev`
